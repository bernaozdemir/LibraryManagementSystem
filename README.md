This project is developed using Java to create a **Library Management System**. Users can borrow books, return them, pay fines, and get information about the available books in the system.

## **Project Features**

- 🛑 **Borrowing Restrictions**: Users with high fines cannot borrow books.
- 🧑‍💻 **Different User Types**: There are different features and restrictions for students, academic staff, and guest users.
